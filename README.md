A repository dedicated to my journey of solving challenging mathematical and computational problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). All solutions are implemented in Python.

## üìã About Project Euler

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Please note that **Project Euler discourages the sharing of solutions online** for problems beyond #100. The problems are intended to be solved individually to preserve the integrity and learning experience for others.

**This repository is for my personal use to track progress and showcase my problem-solving approach. I strongly encourage you to try solving the problems yourself first before looking at any solutions.**

## üöÄ Purpose of This Repository

*   **Personal Log:** To track my progress and thought process as I work through the problems.
*   **Code Practice:** To improve my algorithmic thinking and efficiency in Python.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** To demonstrate clean, well-documented Python code that might help others *after* they have solved the problem themselves.

## üêç Tech Stack

All solutions are written in **Python 3**. The goal is to write efficient, readable, and "Pythonic" code.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem number for easy navigation. Each solution includes the source code and the answer. The solutions are in /solutions directory. 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**If you haven't attempted or solved the problem yet, looking at the solution will rob you of the "Aha!" moment and the learning experience that Project Euler is designed to provide.**

The joy of Project Euler comes from the struggle and eventual breakthrough. I urge you to embrace the challenge before referencing any code here.

## ü§ù Contributing & Corrections

While this is primarily a personal repository, I believe in continuous improvement. If you have:

*   Found a bug in one of my solutions.
*   Discovered a more efficient or Pythonic algorithm.
*   Noticed an error in an explanation.

Please feel free to contribute! You can:
1.  Open a **Pull Request** with a clear description of the change.
2.  Open an **Issue** to discuss the problem.

## üì¨ Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or need to discuss a solution without creating a GitHub issue, you can reach me at:

**Email: [mohammad.rajabi.ba@gmail.com]**

## üìú License

This repository is licensed under the MIT License. This means you are free to use the code for learning purposes, but please be mindful of the Project Euler spirit and avoid using it to simply copy answers.
